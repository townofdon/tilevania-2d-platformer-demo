Goals for music:

- Create an audio manager - prob needs to be a singleton
- Start playing the STRINGS sample
- Overlay additional tracks when the player enters a collider - layer Audio

How to implement??

- Cut up current tracks into loopable samples
- Unity prob has a way to play looped audio - figure out if this is the case
  - If so, we only need to worry about starting/stopping things at the correct time
- BPM is 150 - do maths based on time to play 1-bar loops
- On PLAY - enqueue a loop to start on the next bar
- On STOP - enqueue a loop to end after the current bar

Timing is important - we probably cannot rely on the Update method since it is frame-based;
this will cause things to get out of sync.

Instead:

- Keep track of time elapsed since start of game
- Run a Coroutine that starts a track at (timeFromGameStart + timeFromGameStart % timePerBar)

OR:

- Look into FMod - seems like that has multitrack capability and it may be straightforward to hook into Unity
