# tilevania-2d-platformer-demo

A demo 2D Platformer built in Unity.

This project started from a [simple tutorial from GameDev.TV](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-2d-game-dev-course-2021/?coupon_code=NEWYEAR).
However, as the project scaled, I wanted to try more and more things such as:

- Start / GameOver / Win Screens
- Player Movement
  - Coyote time (allowing a late-jump from a platform)
  - Code-driven sprite animation state machine
  - Non-realistic gravity (player falls faster when returning to ground - this makes the game feel much more responsive and less "floaty")
  - Applied controller joystick dead zones
- Player UI - healthbar, lives, coins, etc.
- Attacks
  - Ability to squash enemies by stomping from above (like Mario)
  - Bow & arrow weapon
- Tracking player & enemy HP
- Dynamic music scoring based on map "zones" - adding more and more tracks play in sync despite being queued up at different times (e.g. strings, bass, drums etc.)
- Code-driven dynamic camera positioning

I pulled heavily from these resources as well:
